These pages describe a git and github workflow for the NDlib project.

There are several different workflows here, for different ways of working with NDlib.

This is not a comprehensive git reference, it’s just a workflow for our own project. It’s tailored to the github hosting service. You may well find better or quicker ways of getting stuff done with git, but these should get you started.

For general resources for learning git, see git resources.
