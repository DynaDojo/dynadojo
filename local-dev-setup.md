# Recommended Tools
1. pyenv for managing python versions
2. pdm for managing virtual environments and packages

If you don't have these installed, you can install them with `homebrew` on MacOS. 

# Python Version
Make sure you are working with Python 3.10 to 3.11
If using pyenv,
```
pyenv versions #check installed versions
pyenv install 3.10
pyenv local 3.10 #set the current directory default version
```

# Package Installation
```
pdm install 
```
